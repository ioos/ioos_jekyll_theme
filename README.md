# Jekyll theme for IOOS GitHub pages

This repo holds the common Jekyll theme code for IOOS GitHub.io documentation sites.  The IOOS theme is based on IOOS'
fork of the ['Minimal Mistakes'](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
Jekyll theme originally developed for IOOS Catalog documentation site: https://ioos.github.io/catalog/.

An example version of this template is available here: [https://ioos.github.io/ioos_jekyll_theme](https://ioos.github.io/ioos_jekyll_theme).  

Instructions for downloading and creating your own documentation site based on this template code is available
[here](https://ioos.github.io/ioos_jekyll_theme/pages/jekyll/).  Following these instructions will provide you with
the Ruby/Jekyll environment on your desktop and a clone of the ['gh-pages'](https://github.com/ioos/ioos_jekyll_theme/tree/gh-pages)
branch of this repository, which has a git submodule reference to the common template code in the master branch.

Updates to the IOOS GitHub.io documentation site based on this template can therefore be managed more easily via update
of template code once in the master branch of this repository followed by running git submodule update commands in each
of the downstream repositories that reference it.
